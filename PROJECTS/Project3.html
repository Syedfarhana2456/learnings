        <p>Himalayas have had a profound impact on the culture of the people in the region. The Himalayan region is occupied by people of various religions
           and several places in the Himalayas are of religious significance in, Bon, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, and Sikhism.
           Hindus form the majority of the low highlands and plains in Northern India and Nepal. People in high altitude region of Ladakh, Bhutan, 
           and North East India follow Buddhism while Islam is dominant in the western region of the Himalayas and the Kashmir valley. Tibetan religions are followed 
           in the northern Himalayas and various ethnicities in North East India follow indigenous religions. For the Hindus, Himalaya is a personification Himavat,
            the king of all mountains and the father of goddess Parvati.[127] It is also considered to be the birthplace of goddess Ganga, the personification of river Ganges.

        <h2>Climate And Weather Regulaton</h2>
        <p>Due to its location and size, the Himalayas acts as a climatic barrier which affects the weather conditions of the Indian subcontinent and the regions north of the range.
         The mountains are spread across more than eight degrees of latitude and hence includes a wide range of climatic zones including sub-tropical, temperate, and semi-arid. 
         The climate in a region is determined by factors such as altitude, latitude, and the impact on monsoon. There are generally five seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn 
         or post-monsoon, winter, and spring. The summer in April-May is followed by monsoon rains from June to September. The post monsoon season is largely devoid of rain
          and snow before beginning of cold winters in December-January with intermediate spring before the summer.</p>
