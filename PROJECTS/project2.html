    <h2>Blessed Teresa of Calcutta</h2>
    <p><b>Mother Teresa or Saint Mother Teresa</b>, was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun, founder of the Missionaries of Charity and is a Catholic saint.
     Born in Skopje, then part of the Ottoman Empire, she was raised in a devoutly Catholic family. At the age of 18, 
     she moved to Ireland to join the Sisters of Loreto and later to India,
     where she lived most of her life and carried out her missionary work.
     On 4 September 2016, she was canonised by the Catholic Church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. 
     The anniversary of her death, 5 September, is now observed as her feast day.
     Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation that was initially dedicated to serving the poorest of the poor" in the slums of Calcutta.
    Over the decades, the congregation grew to operate in over 133 countries, as of 2012, with more than 4,500 nuns managing homes for those dying from HIV/AIDS,
    leprosy, and tuberculosis, as well as running soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, orphanages, and schools.
    Members of the order take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.
    Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. 
    Her life and work have inspired books, documentaries, and films. Her authorized biography, written by Navin Chawla, was published in 1992, and on 6 September 2017,
    she was named a co-patron of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta alongside St Francis Xavier. However, 
    she was also a controversial figure, drawing criticism for her staunch opposition to abortion,
    divorce and contraception, as well as the poor conditions and lack of medical care or pain relief in her houses for the dying
