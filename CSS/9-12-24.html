        <h1>FRIENDSHIP</h1>
        <p>
            Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people.
            It is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an "acquaintance" or an "association", such as a classmate, neighbor, coworker, or colleague.
            In some cultures,the concept of friendship is restricted to a small number of very deep relationships; in others,
            such as the U.S. and Canada, a person could have many friends,
            and perhaps a more intense relationship with one or two people, who may be called good friends or best friends.
            Other colloquial terms include besties or Best Friends Forever (BFFs). Although there are many forms of friendship,
            certain features are common to many such bonds, such as choosing to be with one another, enjoying time spent together,
            and being able to engage in a positive and supportive role to one another.
